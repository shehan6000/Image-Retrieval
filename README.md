# Image-Retrieval
## Overview

In this project, we will learn how to use the ðŸ¤— Transformers library for image-text retrieval tasks. Specifically, we will use a pre-trained model to determine how well a given image matches a text description. This lesson will cover loading the necessary models and processors, processing images and texts, and evaluating the match probability between them.
